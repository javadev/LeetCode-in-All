76\. Minimum Window Substring

Hard

Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return _the **minimum window substring** of_ `s` _such that every character in_ `t` _(**including duplicates**) is included in the window. If there is no such substring__, return the empty string_ `""`_._

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is **unique**.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"

**Output:** "BANC"

**Explanation:** The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t. 

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "a", t = "a"

**Output:** "a"

**Explanation:** The entire string s is the minimum window. 

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "a", t = "aa"

**Output:** ""

**Explanation:** Both 'a's from t must be included in the window. Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string. 

**Constraints:**

*   `m == s.length`
*   `n == t.length`
*   <code>1 <= m, n <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

To solve the "Minimum Window Substring" problem in Swift with the Solution class, follow these steps:

1. Define a method `minWindow` in the `Solution` class that takes two strings `s` and `t` as input and returns the minimum window substring of `s` containing all characters from `t`.
2. Create two frequency maps: `tFreqMap` to store the frequency of characters in string `t`, and `sFreqMap` to store the frequency of characters in the current window of string `s`.
3. Initialize two pointers `left` and `right` to track the window boundaries. Initialize a variable `minLength` to store the minimum window length found so far.
4. Iterate over string `s` using the `right` pointer until the end of the string:
   - Update the frequency map `sFreqMap` for the character at index `right`.
   - Check if the current window contains all characters from `t`. If it does, move the `left` pointer to minimize the window while maintaining the condition.
   - Update the `minLength` if the current window length is smaller.
   - Move the `right` pointer to expand the window.
5. Return the minimum window substring found, or an empty string if no such substring exists.

Here's the implementation of the `minWindow` method in Swift:

```swift
class Solution {
    func minWindow(_ s: String, _ t: String) -> String {
        let sChars = Array(s)
    let tChars = Array(t)
    var tCount = [Character: Int]()
    
    // Store the count of each character in t
    for char in tChars {
        tCount[char, default: 0] += 1
    }
    
    var windowStart = 0
    var windowEnd = 0
    var minWindowSize = Int.max
    var minWindowStart = 0
    var count = tChars.count
    
    while windowEnd < sChars.count {
        let charEnd = sChars[windowEnd]
        
        // If the character at windowEnd is in t, decrease the count
        if let charCount = tCount[charEnd] {
            if charCount > 0 {
                count -= 1
            }
            tCount[charEnd] = charCount - 1
        }
        
        // Move windowStart to the right until all characters in t are included
        while count == 0 {
            let currentWindowSize = windowEnd - windowStart + 1
            
            // Update the minimum window size and start position if necessary
            if currentWindowSize < minWindowSize {
                minWindowSize = currentWindowSize
                minWindowStart = windowStart
            }
            
            let charStart = sChars[windowStart]
            
            // If the character at windowStart is in t, increase the count
            if let charCount = tCount[charStart] {
                if charCount == 0 {
                    count += 1
                }
                tCount[charStart] = charCount + 1
            }
            
            windowStart += 1
        }
        
        windowEnd += 1
    }
    
        // Return the minimum window substring or an empty string if not found
        if minWindowSize == Int.max {
            return ""
        } else {
            let minWindowEnd = minWindowStart + minWindowSize
            return String(sChars[minWindowStart..<minWindowEnd])
        }
    }
}
```

This implementation finds the minimum window substring in `O(m + n)` time complexity, where `m` is the length of string `s` and `n` is the length of string `t`. It uses two frequency maps to keep track of character frequencies and adjusts the window boundaries to find the minimum window containing all characters from `t`.
